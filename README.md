# OS-0

OS-0 Project Overview

Project Name: OS-0
Objective: Develop a minimal operating system from scratch to gain deep, practical knowledge of operating system design and low-level systems programming.

Purpose:
OS-0 is an educational and exploratory project aimed at understanding the internal workings of modern operating systems by building one from the ground up. This project will serve as a foundation for mastering systems-level development and is part of a long-term goal to become a highly proficient systems engineer.

Key Focus Areas:

    Bootloader and system initialization

    Kernel development (written in C and/or Assembly)

    Memory management (physical and virtual memory)

    Hardware interfacing (interrupts, timers, I/O drivers)

    Process scheduling and multitasking

    Filesystem basics

    System calls and user/kernel mode separation

    Basic shell or command-line interface

Platform/Architecture: x86 (with potential to target x86_64 later)
Toolchain: GCC cross-compiler, GRUB, QEMU, NASM (or other assemblers), Make
Build Target: Multiboot-compliant kernel bootable via GRUB

Status: Early development / Learning phase
Repository Purpose: Documentation of development process, tracking incremental goals, version control of code, and sharing of educational resources

Final version for build 0 (Zero) will be an ISO.
